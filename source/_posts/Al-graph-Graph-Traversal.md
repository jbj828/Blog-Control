graph traversal

<!-- more -->

### What is Graph Traversal?

Graph traversal refers to the process of visiting each vertex in a graph.

### Types of Graph Traversal

  * Breadth First Search(BFS)
  * Depth First Search(DFS)

### What is 'Breadth First Search'(BFS)?

BFS is an algorithm for traversing Graph data structures. It starts at some arbitrary node of a graph and explores the neighbor nodes(which are at current level) first, before moving to the next level neighbors.

### Handling one Special Scenario of BFS

  * Disconnected Graph
    * Cannot traverse the graph with BFS. Because the vertecis are disconneted with each other.

### Time Complexity - BFS

  * Time Complexity - O(V+E)
  * Space Complexity - O(V+E)
