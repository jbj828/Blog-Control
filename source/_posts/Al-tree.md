Tree Data Structure

<!-- more -->

__Properties of Tree__
* Used to represent data in hierarchical form
* Every Node(ideally) has 2 components(Data & Reference)
* It has a Root node and 2 disjoint binary tree called left subtree and right subtree

<br><br>

__Why we learn Tree?__
* Linked List is better in space efficiency over Array. However, Linked List does not have that good time efficiency on Insertion, Deletion and Searching which is O(n). 
* Tree data structure overcomes the problem of linked list.

__Tree Terminologies__
* Root : Node with no parent
* Edge : Link from parent to child
* Leaf : Node with no children
* Sibling : Children of same parent
* Ancestor : means parent, grand-parent, great grand parent, and so on for a given node
* Depth of node : Length of the path from root to node
* Height of node : Length of the path from that node to the deepest node
* Height of tree : Same as height of Root node
* Predecessor : Predecessor of a node is the immediate previous node in Inorder traversal of the Binary Tree.
* Successor : Successor of a node is the immediate next node in Inorder traversal of the Binary Tree.
