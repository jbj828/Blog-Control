Binary Tree


<!-- more -->


__What is Binary Tree__
* A tree is called as binary tree if each node has zero, one or two child.
* It is a family of Data Structure(BST, Heap tree, AVL, Red-Black, Syntax tree, Huffman Coding tree, etc.)

<br><br>

__Why should we learn Binary tree__

* Prerequisite for more advanced trees
* Is used in solving specific problems like:
  * Huffman Coding
  * Heap(Priority Queue)
  * Expression parsing

<br><Br>

__Types of Binary Tree__
* Strict Binary Tree : if each node has either 2 children or none.
* Full Binary Tree : if each non leaf node has 2 children and all lead nodes are at same level
* Complete Binary Tree : if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible

<br><Br>

__Tree Representation__

* Using Linked List
* Using Array
