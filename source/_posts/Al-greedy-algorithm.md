## Greedy Algorithm

  * Greedy Algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece.
  * It always chooses the next piece that offers `the most obvious and immediate benefit`.
  * Greedy fits perfectly for those solutions in which choosing a locally optimal solution also leads to global optimal solution(aka 'Greedy Choice').

## Divide & Conquer

  * Divide & Conquer is an algorithm design paradigm which works by recursively breaking down a problem into sub-problems of similar type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
